# Python Port Scanner

A versatile Python-based port scanner designed for efficient network reconnaissance.

## Overview

This port scanner allows users to scan multiple targets and specified port ranges simultaneously, providing insights into open ports and associated services. Built with multithreading for enhanced speed and flexibility, it serves as a fundamental tool for cybersecurity ethusiasts

## Features

- **Multithreaded Scanning:** Scan multiple targets or port ranges simultaneously for faster results.
  
- **Service Version Detection:** Identify the service running on each open port to enhance reconnaissance.

- **Timeout Handling:** Set a timeout for socket connections to avoid getting stuck on slow or unresponsive targets.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear prompts and progress indicators for a better scanning experience.

## Usage

Enter Targets and Port Range:

Enter target IP addresses (comma-separated for multiple targets).
Specify a port range (e.g., 1-100).
Enjoy Scanning:
The script will initiate the scan and provide insights into open ports.
